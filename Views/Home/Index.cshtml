                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>
                            We want to make Utah roads safer through better access to historical accident and collision data. Using this data, we are able to gain valuable
                            insights into not only what factors cause collisions but also how those factors impact the severity of a collision.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Let’s work together to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">#yeet</a> accidents out of our lives!
                        </p>
                        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
                        <h4>Accident Search</h4>
                        <p>
                            In compiling this data, we are able to offer it to the public in the form of a searchable database. Head on over to the <i>Accident Search page
                            </i> to search through Utah accident data from 2016, 2017, and 2019. Want to narrow down your search? Filter your results based on County,
                            City, and Severity. If you know a specific accident ID number, or if you want to search by a specific road name, use the search bar to find
                            any matches.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To view all the specifics of an accident, click on the accident to be taken to a page displaying the details and a map of where it
                            occurred.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Severity Calculator</h4>
                        <p>
                            Accident severity is a term you'll come across multiple places on our site. Accident severity is defined in numeric value beginning with 5
                            and ending with 1:
                            <br />
                            <ol reversed>
                                <li>Fatal</li>
                                <li>Suspected Serious Injury</li>
                                <li>Suspected Minor Injury</li>
                                <li>Possible Injury</li>
                                <li>No Injury</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br />
                            These numbers help us to understand the accident data we are seeing. Real people and real lives lie behind these numbers, so we need to
                            learn what we can by understanding what the numbers mean.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the <i>Accident Severity page</i>, you will see the conditions that go into calculating an accident's severity. Use the toggles to
                            simulate an accident to learn what leads to worse crashes. The better informed we are, the better we can eliminate, or at the very least
                            be aware of, these factors while we drive.
                        </p>
